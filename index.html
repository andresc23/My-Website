          <p class="lead">Thank you for checking out my website!</p>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <p>After graduating with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I have spent my time working on personal projects, eagerly learning new things, and developing my skills as a software developer.</p>
          <p>While I am open to doing different types of work, I do enjoy front-end development and UI/UX design the most (which is a reason why I made this website.) I'm looking for experiences to learn more about career paths and ways to grow into a Front-end, or even a full stack developer.</p>

                        <dt>C</dt>
                        <dd>I used this language mainly throughout my time in undergrad to understand basic fundamentals such as Data Structures, Computer Networks, and Compilers.</dd>
                        <dt>C++</dt>
                        <dd>I first used this language in high school to understand basic fundamentals, and later on in university to understand Data Structures.</dd>
                        <dt>HTML and CSS</dt>
                        <dd>I first learned about these languages in university. I understand the basics and continue to learn more about and utlize these languages. This website is one example of my continual usage and learning of HTML and CSS.</dd>
                        <dt>Python</dt>
                        <dd>I picked up and learned the language on my own. I applied my understanding of basic concepts and fundamentals from C/C++ to help me learn Python. I am currently finding working on projects to find ways to apply Python and further my understanding of it.</dd>
                        <dt>Javascript</dt>
                        <dd>I learned about Javascript in undergrad and continue to utilize the language in tandem with HTML. I have experience with Node.js (and a bit of SQL) when I used them both for my senior capstone project.</dd>

                      <dd>Growing up in Watsonville, I would volunteer at Our Lady of Assumption Church. Even when I moved to Clovis, when I would come back to stay with my family over the summers I would still volunteer at the church. During this time, I worked at the front desk, providing customer service, doing clerical work such as keeping track of records (i.e where people were baptized, had their first communions, married, etc.) During my undergrad, I would go back to work over the summers when I couldn't get another job. During this time, I worked as a Maintenance Assistant where I would make sure the parish was clean and everything was working well and maintained. One event that I would always help in was the Annual Parish Festival, where I would help set up each post and make each post was well-stocked and the grounds were clean. I would also coordinate supplies and set-up and help clean up and put everything away afterwards.</dd>

                      <dd>During the school years I worked as a Test Proctor. I would proctor exams for students during the school year, and would proctor exams for 50+ students during final's week. Outide of proctoring, I would also do more clerical work, such as entering students' start and end times, keeping track of finished and unfinished exams, and prep future exams for the rest of the week.</dd>
